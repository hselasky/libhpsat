# LibHPMSAT
This repository contains a library for working with linear formulas.
It supports addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Unlike other SAT libraries, this library tries to derive a solution
by equation instead of trial and error. Also the library has been
optimised to handle large amounts of variables.

## How to build under FreeBSD
